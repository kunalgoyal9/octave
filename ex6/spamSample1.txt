Hi, 

Before I begin, read this quote:

“No matter how smart, people usually see what they're already looking for, that's all.” - Veronica Roth 

If bias is all about “black” and “white” to you, then you need to look beyond BuzzFeed.

Several studies show that a recruitment process can be very biased. Recruiters often make decisions based on the age, race, ethnicity, beliefs, and gender of their candidates. These have a direct or indirect impact on the quality of desired outcomes. 

There are several reasons why, as a recruiter, you should be convinced about avoiding bias when hiring for a position. These reasons could be both legal and performance based.

I am writing this email today to share this article to help you understand the various types of bias in the system and how you can avoid them (in case you don’t already know). 

I understand that not many talk about it, but some people like yourself might take a stand, and we want to know your views. 

Happy recruiting!
